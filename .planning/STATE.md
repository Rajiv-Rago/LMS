# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-06)

**Core value:** Anyone can turn a topic into a structured, high-quality learning path in seconds -- and it gets better every time someone uses it.
**Current focus:** Phase 2: Role Simplification & Course Generation -- In Progress

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 6 (Role Simplification & Course Generation)
Plan: 1 of 3 in current phase -- COMPLETE
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-06 -- Executed plan 02-01 (Role simplification and ownership-based auth)

Progress: [██████----] 60%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: 5 min
- Total execution time: 0.27 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-dark-mode | 2/2 | 10 min | 5 min |
| 02-role-simplification | 1/3 | 6 min | 6 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (5 min), 01-02 (5 min), 02-01 (6 min)
- Trend: Consistent

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 02-role-simplification P01 | 6min | 2 tasks | 15 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [01-01]: Used @custom-variant dark with &:where(.dark, .dark *) for Tailwind CSS 4 class-based dark mode
- [01-01]: Exported pure helper functions from useTheme for direct unit testability
- [01-01]: TransitionEnabler as separate client component for clean separation of concerns
- [Roadmap]: Merged ROLE, CGEN, and DASH requirements into a single phase (Phase 2) -- they form one coherent capability: "a learner can create a course from the dashboard."
- [Roadmap]: Component decomposition is not a standalone phase -- it happens within Phase 3 (bug fixes) and subsequent phases as needed, since it has no user-facing requirements.
- [Roadmap]: BUGS-01 gets its own phase (Phase 3) between role simplification and public catalog to stabilize before opening the platform to unauthenticated users.
- [Phase 01-02]: Removed useDarkMode hook entirely -- ThemeToggle handles all state internally via useTheme
- [Phase 01-02]: Auth layout uses fixed positioning for toggle to stay visible regardless of scroll
- [02-01]: Unified GET /api/courses query for all roles instead of role-based branching
- [02-01]: POST /api/courses restricted to admin-only; teachers no longer create courses manually
- [02-01]: AI generate POST removes role gate entirely; authorization via course ownership check

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: 25+ API routes hard-gate on `user.role === "teacher"` -- Phase 2 planning needs a complete enumeration of every affected route.
- [Research]: Public catalog requires updating the full viewing chain (catalog -> course -> module -> lesson) for unauthenticated access, not just a single page.
- [Research]: Monolithic page components (1152-line course detail, 710-line lesson page) make UI changes risky -- decompose as part of relevant phases.
