# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-06)

**Core value:** Anyone can turn a topic into a structured, high-quality learning path in seconds -- and it gets better every time someone uses it.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [01-01]: Used @custom-variant dark with &:where(.dark, .dark *) for Tailwind CSS 4 class-based dark mode
- [01-01]: Exported pure helper functions from useTheme for direct unit testability
- [01-01]: TransitionEnabler as separate client component for clean separation of concerns
- [Roadmap]: Merged ROLE, CGEN, and DASH requirements into a single phase (Phase 2) -- they form one coherent capability: "a learner can create a course from the dashboard."
- [Roadmap]: Component decomposition is not a standalone phase -- it happens within Phase 3 (bug fixes) and subsequent phases as needed, since it has no user-facing requirements.
- [Roadmap]: BUGS-01 gets its own phase (Phase 3) between role simplification and public catalog to stabilize before opening the platform to unauthenticated users.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: 25+ API routes hard-gate on `user.role === "teacher"` -- Phase 2 planning needs a complete enumeration of every affected route.
- [Research]: Public catalog requires updating the full viewing chain (catalog -> course -> module -> lesson) for unauthenticated access, not just a single page.
- [Research]: Monolithic page components (1152-line course detail, 710-line lesson page) make UI changes risky -- decompose as part of relevant phases.
